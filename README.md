# Implement of Some Common Sorting Algorithms

## Involved Algorithms
1. Bogo Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Shell Sort
- Heap Sort
- Merge Sort

## How to Use?
* Compile with c99 and run: `gcc -std=c99 xxxSort.c && ./a.out`
* For convenience, here just use `int` data type to storage length of the array. If your array is very large, make sure replace it with `unsigned int` or `unsigned long`.
